# Red-Green-Blue

The project uses the reactive spring stack. Currently the connection to the database is not working. There is still some work to be done there.
When the project is started and the index.html page is opened you can work with the red, green and blue sliders and the result color will be shown in the rectangle.
I tried to use thymeleaf engine in the project but there were some problems with the web socket connection and that's why you have to start the project and open the intex.html separately (still there is some work to be done there).
